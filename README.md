# AtomicG
*AtomicG Generator Tool*

The idea with this tool is to provide an easy and intuitive way to generate code for the Backend and Frontend based on a model defined by us and templates that we can have access [here](https://github.com/gorums/AtomicG-Templates/tree/master/templates). 

We want to generate integrated **CRUDs** base on good practices for the most used frameworks today such as **Angular**, **React**, **DotNet Core**, **ExpressJs**, etc.
